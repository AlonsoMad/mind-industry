                As AI agents and large context databases become central to enterprise operations, a fundamental question
                arises:

                This project builds upon the foundational research in
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multilingual Discrepancy
                    Detection</a>. Originally designed to detect cultural and factual discrepancies in multilingual QA
                systems, MIND's powerful AI engine has been repurposed to meet the industrial demand of purging and
                pruning large context DBs.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>MIND</strong> provides a powerful, user-in-the-loop AI pipeline designed to systematically
                detect contradictions and discrepancies within text and contextual databases.
                Our mission is to prune and maintain contextual integrity within large context DBs.
            </p>

            <p>
                By combining Polylingual Topic Modeling, hybrid retrieval, and advanced LLMs, we empower users to
                identify, review, and resolve inconsistencies. This ensures that the data feeding AI agents—whether in
                large corporate environments, technical documentation, or specialized knowledge bases—is trustworthy,
                factually accurate, and free of contradictions.
