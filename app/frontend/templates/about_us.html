                We are a team of researchers from <strong>Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</strong> and the
                <strong>University of Maryland</strong> working to uncover inconsistencies and knowledge gaps within the
                multilingual resources that support multilingual Question Answering systems.

                Our work was inspired by
                <a href="https://today.umd.edu/pocket-sized-support-for-new-parents" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">ROSIE</a>, a bilingual (English and Spanish) health-support chatbot for new parents.
                Although ROSIE is built on two independent, medically validated knowledge bases, we found that the
                English and Spanish sources often differ. They sometimes present incomplete, conflicting, or culturally
                divergent guidelines.

                        When two answers are grounded in credible evidence yet offer different guidance, which one
                        should we trust?

                MIND aims to address this challenge by systematically detecting such discrepancies. The system lets
                users select a topic, review the inconsistencies it identifies, and decide if the detection is accurate
                and how to proceed.
