1,"Q: I heard that the vitamin K shot might cause cancer. Is this true: A: No. In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an “association” between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer. An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person, but doesn’t tell us whether one causes the other. Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot. If vitamin K was causing cancer, we would expect to see the same association in other groups of children. Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association in other children, but this association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.","['In the early 1990s, a small study in England found an association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer.', 'An association means that two things are happening at the same time in the same person but does not tell us whether one causes the other.', 'Figuring out whether vitamin K might cause childhood cancer was very important because every newborn is expected to get a vitamin K shot.', 'If vitamin K was causing cancer, scientists would expect to see the same association in other groups of children.', 'Scientists looked to see if they could find the same association between vitamin K and childhood cancer in other children.', 'The association between vitamin K and childhood cancer was never found again in any other study.']"
2,"But what if you know for sure that you never want to be pregnant again, or even pregnant ever?

4,"Which children are at risk for X-linked agammaglobulinemia: Women who are carriers have a 1 in 2 chance of passing the faulty X chromosome to a child. This is true for every pregnancy.

5,"Your baby can go through periods of increased hunger and fussiness. This increase in hunger means your baby is going through a period of fast growth (a growth spurt).
