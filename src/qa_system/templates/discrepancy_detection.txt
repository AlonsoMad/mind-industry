- CULTURAL_DISCREPANCY: The answers reflect differences influenced by cultural norms, values, or social perspectives.  
- FRAMING_DISCREPANCY: The answers are based on the same core information but differ in wording, emphasis, or perspective.  
- NOT_ENOUGH_INFO: There is insufficient information to determine whether a discrepancy exists.  
- NO_DISCREPANCY: The answers are consistent with each other.
