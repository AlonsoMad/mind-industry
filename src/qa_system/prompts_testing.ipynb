Among firms with 50 or more enrollees offering health benefits:\\n- Overall – Twenty-eight percent of firms say that telemedicine will be “very important” in providing access to enrollees in the future, and another 32% of firms say that it will be “important.”\\n- Behavioral Health Services – Forty-one percent say that telemedicine will be “very important” in providing access to behavioral health services in the future, and another 30% say that it will be “important”. Larger firms (1,000 or more workers) are more likely than smaller firms to say that telemedicine will be “very important” to providing access to behavioral health services.

       "668200   With the effects of the pandemic waning, medical services are generally available on an in-person basis and many employees have partially or fully returned to their workplaces. With this context, we asked employers how important they felt telemedicine would be in providing care to employees going forward, both overall and for several specific types of services. Among firms with 50 or more enrollees offering health benefits:\\n- Overall – Twenty-eight percent of firms say that telemedicine will be “very important” in providing access to enrollees in the future, and another 32% of firms say that it will be “important.”\\n- Behavioral Health Services – Forty-one percent say that telemedicine will be “very important” in providing access to behavioral health services in the future, and another 30% say that it will be “important”. Larger firms (1,000 or more workers) are more likely than smaller firms to say that telemedicine will be “very important” to providing access to behavioral health services. (57% vs. 40%).\\n- Primary Care – Twenty-seven percent say that telemedicine will be “very important” in providing access to primary care in the future, and another 34% say that it will be “important” to providing access primary care.\\n- Specialty Care – Sixteen percent say that telemedicine will be “very important” in providing access to specialty care in the future, and another 30% say that it will be “important” to providing access to specialty care..   \n",

Rejection only means that the transplant team needs to fine-tune the immunosuppressant medications your child is taking to prevent his immune system from trying to reject the liver. When a rejection episode occurs, your child's doctor may prescribe a short-term steroid treatment, then adjust the dose of antirejection medications.   \n",

The doctor will put the ICD leads (wires) through the cut. For one type of ICD, your doctor puts one or two leads in a large blood vessel and threads them into the heart. For another type, the lead may be placed under the skin through a small cut in the middle of your chest. Then your doctor connects the leads to the ICD. Your doctor puts the ICD under the skin of your chest and closes the cut. Your doctor also programs the ICD.   \n",

Pone que tiene sobrepeso. ¿Qué significa? ¿Qué debo hacer? – Amy El índice de masa corporal (IMC) es un cálculo que tiene en cuenta la estatura y el peso para estimar cuánta grasa corporal tiene una persona. La obesidad infantil es un problema importante; por eso, muchas escuelas han agregado la medición del índice de masa corporal a la revisión anual de salud escolar de todos los alumnos. A algunos padres les incomoda la idea de recibir un informe escolar del IMC de sus hijos. Pero los niños con sobrepeso tienen más probabilidades de desarrollar problemas de salud, como la hipertensión (tensión arterial alta) y la diabetes. Los padres deben compartir el informe escolar del IMC con el médico de sus hijos, quien les puede ayudar a interpretar los resultados y darles recomendaciones. He aquí algunos consejos para ayudar a un niño a mantener un peso saludable: - Anime a su hijo a estar activo todos los días. Los expertos recomiendan que los niños hagan 60 minutos o más de actividad física cada día. - Ofrezca a su hijo fruta y verdura en las comidas y los tentempiés, y anímelo a tomar cinco o más raciones de estos alimentos al día. - Sírvale raciones de tamaño adecuado teniendo en cuenta la edad de su hijo. - Limite las bebidas endulzadas con azúcares y ofrézcale leche semidescremada o agua en su lugar. - Limite el tiempo que pasa su hijo delante de pantallas (televisión, videojuegos, teléfono inteligente, computadora u otros dispositivos) a menos de 2 horas al día. - Dé un buen ejemplo, llevando una dieta saludable, manteniéndose activo físicamente y limitando el tiempo que pasa delante de pantallas.',\n",

       "    'full_doc': 'Infección por E. coli por los alimentos o el agua Generalidades de la afección ¿Qué es una infección por E. coli? E. coli ( Escherichia coli) es el nombre de un microbio, o bacteria, que vive en el tubo digestivo de los seres humanos y de los animales. Hay diferentes tipos de E. coli, y la mayoría de ellos son inofensivos. Sin embargo, algunos pueden causar diarrea sanguinolenta (con sangre). Algunas cepas de la bacteria E. coli también pueden causar anemia grave o insuficiencia renal, que puede provocar la muerte. Otras cepas de E. coli pueden causar infecciones urinarias u otras infecciones. ¿Cuál es la causa de una infección intestinal por E. coli? Usted puede contraer una infección por E. coli al entrar en contacto con excrementos, o heces, de seres humanos o de animales. Esto puede suceder cuando bebe agua o come alimentos que han sido contaminados con excremento. E. coli en los alimentos E. coli puede llegar a la carne durante el procesamiento. Si la carne infectada no se cocina a 160°F (71°C), las bacterias pueden sobrevivir e infectarlo cuando come la carne. Esta es la manera más común en que las personas en los Estados Unidos se infectan con E. coli. Cualquier alimento que haya estado en contacto con carne cruda también puede infectarse. Otros alimentos que se pueden infectar con E. coli incluyen: - Leche o productos lácteos crudos. Las bacterias pueden propagarse de las ubres de una vaca a su leche. Revise las etiquetas de los productos lácteos para asegurarse de que contengan la palabra \"pasteurizado\". Esto significa que el alimento se ha calentado para destruir las bacterias. - Frutas y verduras crudas, como la lechuga, los brotes de alfalfa, o la sidra sin pasteurizar u otros jugos sin pasteurizar que hayan entrado en contacto con excremento de animales infectados. E. coli en el agua A veces, el excremento humano o animal infectado con E. coli llega a lagos, piscinas y suministros de agua. Las personas pueden infectarse cuando el suministro de agua de una ciudad o de un pueblo contaminados no ha sido tratado en forma adecuada con cloro o cuando las personas tragan de manera accidental agua contaminada mientras nadan en un lago, en una piscina o en un canal de riego. E. coli por el contacto de persona a persona Las bacterias también pueden transmitirse de una persona a otra, por lo general, cuando una persona infectada no se lava bien las manos después de una evacuación del intestino. La E. coli puede pasar de las manos de una persona infectada a otras personas u objetos. ¿Cuáles son los síntomas? Los síntomas principales de una infección intestinal por E. coli son: - Diarrea sanguinolenta (con sangre). - Cólicos estomacales. - Náuseas y vómito. Algunas personas no notan ningún síntoma. Los niños tienen más probabilidades que los adultos de tener síntomas. Por lo general, los síntomas comienzan 3 o 4 días después de haber entrado en contacto con la E. coli. La mayoría de las personas se mejoran en alrededor de una semana. Con frecuencia, no consultan a un médico y no saben que la E. coli causó sus problemas. Cuando la E. coli causa problemas graves en la sangre o en los riñones, los síntomas incluyen: - Piel pálida. - Fiebre. - Debilidad. - Moretones. - Eliminación de poca cantidad de orina. ¿Cómo se diagnostica una infección intestinal por E. coli? Es posible que su médico sospeche que usted tiene una infección por E. coli después de hacerle preguntas y un examen. Es probable que se le realice una prueba de sus heces para detectar E. coli. ¿Cómo se trata? La infección por E. coli suele desaparecer por sí sola. Su principal tratamiento consiste en ponerse cómodo y beber sorbos de agua. La diarrea hace que el cuerpo pierda más agua de lo habitual. Esto puede provocar deshidratación, que es especialmente peligrosa para los bebés y los adultos mayores. Tomar frecuentes pequeños sorbos de agua ayudará a prevenir la deshidratación. Si tiene diarrea sanguinolenta que podría ser causada por una infección por E. coli, no tome medicamentos para la diarrea ni antibióticos. Estos medicamentos pueden desacelerar el proceso de digestión y hacer que el cuerpo tenga más tiempo para absorber las toxinas producidas por la E. coli. En lugar de eso, llame a su médico. En algunas personas la infección por E. coli causa graves problemas en la sangre y en los riñones. Estas personas podrían necesitar transfusiones de sangre o diálisis. La diálisis es un tratamiento que ayuda a filtrar los productos de desecho de la sangre cuando los riñones no trabajan en forma adecuada. ¿Cómo previene una infección intestinal por E. coli? Los alimentos y el agua que están infectados con los microbios de E. coli tienen un aspecto y un olor normales. Sin embargo, hay algunas medidas que puede tomar para prevenir la infección: - Cocine la carne de res molida a, al menos, 160°F (71°C). - En la cocina, lávese las manos con agua caliente y jabonosa con frecuencia, especialmente después de tocar carne cruda. - Lave cualquier utensilio o superficie de la cocina que hayan tocado carne cruda. - Use solo leche, productos lácteos y jugos pasteurizados. - Use solo agua potable tratada o clorada. - Cuando viaje a países que podrían tener agua potable no segura, no use hielo ni beba agua del grifo. Evite frutas y verduras crudas, excepto aquellas con piel que pela usted mismo. - Lávese las manos con frecuencia y siempre láveselas después de usar el baño o de cambiar pañales. Síntomas Los niños tienen más probabilidades que los adultos de presentar síntomas de una infección por E. coli. La mayoría de las personas con la infección tendrán: - Cólicos estomacales intensos y sensibilidad estomacal. - Diarrea, acuosa en un principio, pero que con frecuencia se torna muy sanguinolenta (con sangre). - Náuseas y vómito. Algunas personas que están infectadas con las bacterias no notan ningún síntoma. Es posible que transmitan las bacterias a otras personas sin saberlo. Hay muchas afecciones con síntomas similares a aquellos de la infección intestinal por E. coli. El diagnóstico de infección por E. coli puede ser complicado por el hecho de que muchas infecciones bacterianas que causan diarrea están acompañadas de fiebre alta. Si no tiene fiebre o solo tiene fiebre leve, su médico podría sospechar que algo diferente de las bacterias está causando sus síntomas. La diarrea sanguinolenta es común en los casos confirmados de infección intestinal por E. coli, pero las bacterias también deberían considerarse una causa posible de diarrea no sanguinolenta. Por lo general, los síntomas de la infección por E. coli desaparecen en alrededor de una semana sin más problemas. Sin embargo, es posible que tenga problemas graves en los riñones y en la sangre dentro de las 2 semanas después del comienzo de la diarrea. Estos problemas pueden causar insuficiencia renal y, a veces, incapacidad a largo plazo o muerte en algunos niños o adultos mayores. Exámenes y pruebas Por lo general, la evaluación médica para la diarrea que podría ser causada por bacterias E. coli patógenas (que causan enfermedades) comienza con un examen físico y una evaluación de antecedentes de salud. Durante la evaluación de los antecedentes de salud, su médico le hará preguntas acerca de sus síntomas, como: - ¿Cuándo comenzó la diarrea, cuánto ha durado y con qué frecuencia mueve el intestino? - ¿Hay sangre en la diarrea? De ser así, ¿cuánta? - ¿Ha tenido escalofríos o fiebre? - ¿Ha tenido cólicos abdominales, náuseas o vómito? - ¿Se siente cansado o irritable? - ¿Se ha desmayado o se ha sentido aturdido (como que se está por desmayar)? La infección por E. coli se confunde fácilmente con otras afecciones con síntomas similares, como otras enfermedades infecciosas. Un médico podría sospechar que usted tiene infección por E. coli si usted ha estado expuesto a las bacterias. Durante la evaluación de los antecedentes de salud, es posible que su médico le pregunte si: - Ha estado en una guardería, una escuela, un hogar para ancianos u otra institución de atención de adultos. - Ha comido recientemente en un restaurante. - Ha consumido carne que no estaba bien cocida, o leche, productos lácteos o jugo no pasteurizados. - Ha tenido contacto con alguna persona con diarrea reciente o crónica. - Ha viajado recientemente. - Ha usado antibióticos recientemente. Por lo general, durante el examen físico, un médico: - Le tomará la temperatura. - Le tomará la presión arterial y determinará la frecuencia del pulso. - Le observará el color de la piel para ver si está inusualmente pálido. - Le revisará el estómago para detectar sensibilidad. - Le realizará un examen rectal para detectar si tiene sangre en las heces. Los médicos que sospechen que tiene una infección por E. coli indicarán un tipo de cultivo de heces que detecta cepas de E. coli. Debido a que las bacterias pueden abandonar el cuerpo en solo algunos días, la muestra se debe obtener tan pronto como sea posible después de que aparezcan los síntomas. A veces, se usan otras pruebas cuando el diagnóstico no es claro; sin embargo, estas aún no están ampliamente disponibles. Si se le diagnostica una infección por E. coli a un niño o a un adulto mayor, es posible que se lo observe para detectar el desarrollo de problemas graves en la sangre o los riñones. La observación requiere análisis de sangre y de orina para medir los elementos esenciales de la sangre y los líquidos del cuerpo. Generalidades del tratamiento El tratamiento de la infección por bacterias E. coli patógenas implica el manejo de complicaciones, principalmente la deshidratación causada por la diarrea. Si presenta síntomas de problemas graves en la sangre o en los riñones, como anemia o insuficiencia renal, es posible que su tratamiento incluya: - Control cuidadoso de los líquidos y de los minerales esenciales. - Diálisis, para filtrar los productos de desecho de la sangre. Algunas personas con insuficiencia renal causada por la infección por E. coli requieren diálisis. - Transfusión de sangre, para tratar la anemia suministrándole glóbulos rojos adicionales ricos en oxígeno. Medicamentos que deben evitarse La mayoría de las personas se recuperan de las infecciones por E. coli después de 5 a 10 días sin necesidad de tomar medicamentos. Los antibióticos no se recomiendan. Informe a su médico si piensa que podría tener infección por E. coli y está tomando antibióticos. Por lo general, los medicamentos para la diarrea sin receta o recetados no se usan para tratar la infección por E. coli. Muchos productos antidiarreicos disminuyen el ritmo con el que se mueven los alimentos y los productos de desecho a través de los intestinos. Esto podría brindarle más tiempo al cuerpo para absorber las toxinas producidas por las bacterias, lo que aumenta el riesgo de complicaciones, como problemas graves en la sangre y en los riñones. Evite estos productos sin receta si tiene o sospecha que tiene una infección por E. coli: - Productos de loperamida. Estos incluyen Imodium, Maalox y otros productos antidiarreicos. Nota: Solo se deben evitar aquellos productos que enumeran la loperamida entre sus ingredientes. - Productos que contengan salicilatos. Estos incluyen el Pepto-Bismol y productos antidiarreicos similares que contengan bismuto, aspirina e ibuprofeno (como Advil). Los salicilatos pueden aumentar el sangrado de los intestinos. Además, los salicilatos están asociados con el síndrome de Reye, una enfermedad poco frecuente, pero grave, en los niños. Es posible que los medicamentos para la diarrea recetados sean perjudiciales para una persona con infección por E. coli. Un médico podría recetar uno de estos medicamentos si no sabe que la E. coli causó la diarrea. Asegúrese de analizar sus síntomas con su médico. Es importante compartir información para obtener el diagnóstico adecuado para su afección. Evite estos medicamentos recetados si tiene o piensa que podría tener una infección por E. coli: - Difenoxina con atropina (Motofen) - Difenoxilato con atropina (Lomotil) - Loperamida (Imodium de concentración recetada) Tratamiento en el hogar El tratamiento en el hogar de la infección por bacterias E. coli patógenas consiste en mantenerse cómodo y en prevenir la transmisión de las bacterias. Si no está infectado, tome medidas para prevenir la infección. Si piensa que usted o alguna persona a su cuidado podría estar infectado por E. coli, comuníquese de inmediato con un médico. No trate los síntomas de la diarrea con medicamentos sin receta ni con medicamentos recetados. El tratamiento en el hogar para la diarrea o la diarrea sanguinolenta (con sangre) causada por la infección por E. coli - No use productos antidiarreicos sin receta si tiene diarrea sanguinolenta o sin sangre si sospecha que podría ser causada por la infección por E. coli. Estos productos incluyen los antidiarreicos Imodium y Maalox Anti-Diarrheal. No tome otros medicamentos que le hayan sobrado para tratar una enfermedad que haya tenido. - Tome frecuentes sorbos pequeños de agua o de una bebida rehidratante para reemplazar los líquidos perdidos y ayudar a prevenir la deshidratación. Debido a que la deshidratación puede ser más peligrosa en los bebés, llame a su médico si piensa que su bebé podría estar deshidratado. El estómago no puede manejar demasiado líquido a la vez. Busque atención médica si manifiesta señales de deshidratación moderada, que incluyen: - Aspecto seco dentro de la boca. - Falta de lágrimas. - Baja producción de orina. - Aturdimiento. Especialmente en niños y en adultos de 65 años o más, preste atención a síntomas de problemas graves en la sangre y en los riñones, como fiebre, debilidad, piel pálida o eliminación de pequeñas cantidades de orina. Si se desarrolla alguno de estos síntomas, consulte a un médico de inmediato. Consejos para protegerse contra la infección por E. coli debido a alimentos y agua contaminados - Cocine carne de res molida a una temperatura de al menos 160°F (71°C). La carne de res molida se debe cocinar hasta que todo el color rosa desaparezca, pero no se confíe solo en el color. Revise la temperatura con un termómetro para carne. Corte las hamburguesas de restaurante y las cocinadas en el hogar para asegurarse de que estén completamente cocidas. Los jugos deben ser claros o amarillos sin ningún matiz rosado. Nunca coma carne de res molida cruda o que no esté bien cocida. - Cuando prepare comida: - Lávese las manos con frecuencia con agua caliente jabonosa, especialmente después de haber manipulado carne cruda. - Siempre lave los utensilios de cocina, las tablas para cortar, los platos, las cubiertas y otros utensilios con agua caliente y detergente inmediatamente después de que hayan entrado en contacto con la carne cruda. No coloque la carne cocida nuevamente sobre el plato en donde estaba la carne cruda, salvo que el plato haya sido muy bien lavado con agua y jabón, y se haya secado. - Use tablas para cortar distintas para la carne cruda y para otros productos alimentarios. - Mantenga la carne, las aves y los mariscos crudos separados de las verduras, las frutas, los panes y otros alimentos que ya se hayan preparado para comer. - Use solo leche, productos lácteos y jugos pasteurizados. Verifique que las etiquetas de los productos contengan la palabra \"pasteurizado\". El jugo hecho con concentrado es el mismo que el pasteurizado. - Use solo agua potable tratada (clorada). - Las personas que viajan a países donde el suministro de agua podría no ser seguro deben ser especialmente cuidadosos de no usar hielo en sus bebidas ni de beber agua del grifo. Toda el agua que se consuma debe ser hervida o embotellada. Coma comidas cuando están calientes. Evite frutas y verduras crudas, excepto aquellas con piel que pela usted mismo. Consejos para prevenir la transmisión de persona a persona de las bacterias de E. coli - Lávese las manos con frecuencia y siempre láveselas después de evacuaciones del intestino o de cambiar pañales. Si su hogar tiene más de un baño, restrinja a la persona infectada al uso de un solo baño. - Deseche los pañales sucios y las heces con cuidado. Si se sospecha que un niño pequeño tiene la infección, use pañales desechables en lugar de pañales de tela hasta que la enfermedad haya desaparecido. - Los adultos deben asegurarse de que los niños que tienen diarrea se laven las manos cuidadosamente después de usar el baño. Los niños infectados por E. coli deben evitar tener contacto con otros niños, particularmente cuando nadan. - Lave las manijas de los inodoros y de los lavabos con un limpiador antibacteriano. - Las personas a las que les han diagnosticado infección por E. coli no deben manipular comida ni trabajar en una guardería ni en otra institución hasta que los resultados de los análisis sean negativos con respecto a las bacterias en dos muestras de heces. Si ha tomado antibióticos, la muestra de heces debe tomarse al menos 48 horas después de que haya tomado la última dosis. - Use cloro en el agua de las piscinas (albercas) y de las tinas calientes.

       "    'full_doc': 'La faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños ¿Qué son la faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños? La faringitis es cuando hay enrojecimiento, dolor e hinchazón de la garganta (faringe). La amigdalitis es la inflamación de las amígdalas. Las amígdalas son dos masas de tejido situadas en ambos lados en la parte posterior de la garganta. Forman parte del sistema inmunitario, un aparato del cuerpo que combate las infecciones y otras enfermedades. Su hijo puede tener faringitis, amigdalitis o ambas (faringoamigdalitis). ¿Cuáles son las causas de la faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños? Muchos factores pueden causar la faringitis. Las infecciones virales son la causa más frecuente. La amigdalitis, por lo general, se produce por infecciones virales o bacterianas. Otras causas pueden ser las siguientes: - Bacterias, como las que causan amigdalitis estreptocócica - Hongos, como los que causan una infección por levaduras - Alergias, como la fiebre del heno o las alergias que afectan a la nariz - Infección de la cavidad nasal - Cánceres - Lesiones - Irritantes, como el humo del cigarrillo o la contaminación del aire - Ácidos estomacales en la garganta ¿Cuáles son los niños que corren riesgo de tener faringitis y amigdalitis? Las infecciones virales y bacterianas se propagan por el contacto estrecho con personas enfermas. Por ejemplo, los niños que asisten al colegio o a la guardería están en riesgo. Particularmente, sucede durante los meses de invierno, cuando ocurren la mayoría de las infecciones virales y bacterianas. ¿Cuáles son los síntomas de la faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños? Los síntomas pueden presentarse de forma un poco diferente en cada niño. Pueden incluir los siguientes: - Dolor de garganta - Dificultad para tragar o dolor al tragar - Glándulas del cuello agrandadas que producen dolor - Ronquera o cambios de voz - Fiebre o escalofríos - Dolor de cabeza - Dolor de oído - Malestar estomacal (náuseas) y vómitos - Dolor abdominal - Sensación de dolor y cansancio - Enrojecimiento o hinchazón de la garganta - Enrojecimiento e inflamación de las amígdalas - La garganta o las amígdalas pueden presentar una supuración blanquecina - Dificultad para respirar o ronquidos Los síntomas de la faringitis y la amigdalitis pueden ser parecidos a los de otras afecciones. Procure que un proveedor de atención médica vea a su hijo para obtener un diagnóstico. ¿Cómo se diagnostican la faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños? El proveedor de atención médica de su hijo le hará preguntas sobre los síntomas que presenta el niño. Revisará la temperatura de su hijo. También lo examinará, prestando mucha atención a los oídos, la nariz, la garganta y las amígdalas. Según los síntomas de su hijo, el proveedor puede hacerle un cultivo de garganta o análisis de sangre. Podrían hacerle una prueba rápida de detección del estreptococo. Se trata de una prueba rápida para comprobar si su hijo tiene amigdalitis estreptocócica. Es importante comprobar si hay amigdalitis estreptocócica para tratarla y prevenir complicaciones. Es posible que a su hijo también le hagan un cultivo de garganta. Sirve para comprobar si hay estreptococo y encontrar el mejor antibiótico para tratarlo. Los resultados pueden tardar unos días. Los análisis de sangre se pueden hacer para revisar si hay infecciones como la mononucleosis infecciosa. ¿Cómo se tratan la faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños? El tratamiento dependerá de los síntomas, de la edad y del estado general de salud de su hijo. También, de la gravedad de la afección. Si su hijo tiene una infección bacteriana, se tratará con antibióticos. Si la causa no es una bacteria, el tratamiento se centrará en hacer que su hijo se sienta cómodo. El tratamiento puede incluir lo siguiente: - Tomar paracetamol o ibuprofeno, líquidos o en pastillas, para el dolor. Se pueden recomendar otros medicamentos o tratamientos para el dolor intenso. Hable con el proveedor de atención médica de su hijo antes de darle cualquier medicamento, sobre todo si es la primera vez que el niño lo usa. - Aumentar la cantidad de líquido que su hijo bebe. Algunos tés tienen ingredientes que alivian la garganta. - Comer alimentos suaves y fríos, como gelatina, helado y paletas heladas. - Hacer gárgaras con agua salada (para niños más grandes). Pídale más instrucciones al proveedor de atención médica de su hijo. - Chupar caramelos para la garganta o duros (para niños más grandes). Es posible que la amigdalitis requiera hospitalización si las amígdalas agrandadas bloquean las vías respiratorias. En algunos niños con amigdalitis recurrente, el proveedor de atención médica puede recomendarle extirpar las amígdalas (amigdalectomía). Es probable que el proveedor de su hijo quiera que consulte con un especialista en garganta, nariz y oídos (otorrinolaringólogo). ¿Cómo puedo prevenir la faringitis y la amigdalitis en mi hijo? Haga lo siguiente para evitar que su hijo se enferme: - Pídale que practique una buena higiene de las manos. - Manténgalo alejado de personas que tengan dolor de garganta, resfriados u otras infecciones de las vías respiratorias superiores. - No fume. Mantenga a su hijo alejado del humo del cigarrillo (tabaquismo pasivo). - Asegúrese de que su hijo esté al día con las vacunas. ¿Cuáles son las complicaciones posibles de la faringitis y la amigdalitis en los niños? Las complicaciones posibles de la faringitis y la amigdalitis incluyen lo siguiente: - Infecciones graves en la zona de la garganta - Pérdida de líquido (deshidratación) del cuerpo por dificultad para comer y beber - Dificultades para respirar debido a amígdalas agrandadas con amigdalitis La amigdalitis estreptocócica sin tratar puede causar problemas de corazón o riñones, infección del oído medio, infección pulmonar o infección del tejido que rodea el encéfalo y la médula espinal. ¿Cuándo llamar al proveedor de atención médica de mi hijo? Llame al proveedor de atención médica de su hijo ante cualquiera de las siguientes situaciones: - Dolor de garganta, en especial si no desaparece a los pocos días - Dolor de garganta y otros síntomas, tales como fiebre Cuándo llamar al 911 Llame al 911 si su hijo presenta lo siguiente: Información importante sobre la faringitis y la amigdalitis en niños - La faringitis es la inflamación de la garganta. La amigdalitis es la inflamación de las amígdalas. - La causa más frecuente son los virus. Su tratamiento no requiere el uso de antibióticos. - Si la infección no es causada por una bacteria, el tratamiento se centrará en hacer que su hijo se sienta cómodo. - Si su hijo tiene dolor de garganta intenso y dificultad para tragar o respirar, babeo, cuello rígido o hinchazón del cuello, llame al 911 o al teléfono de emergencias de su localidad. Próximos pasos Consejos para que aproveche al máximo la consulta con el proveedor de atención médica de su hijo: - Tenga en claro la razón de la consulta y qué quiere que suceda. - Antes de la consulta, anote las preguntas que quiere hacer. - En la visita, anote el nombre de los nuevos diagnósticos y de todo nuevo medicamento, tratamiento o prueba. También anote las instrucciones que el proveedor le dé para su hijo. - Sepa por qué se receta un tratamiento o un medicamento y cómo ayudará a su hijo. Conozca los efectos secundarios. - Pregunte si la afección de su hijo se puede tratar de otra forma. - Sepa por qué se recomienda una prueba o un procedimiento y qué podrían significar los resultados. - Sepa qué esperar si su hijo no toma el medicamento, si no se hace la prueba o no se somete al procedimiento. - Si su hijo tiene una cita de seguimiento, anote la fecha, la hora y el objetivo de la consulta. - Sepa cómo comunicarse con el proveedor de su hijo fuera del horario de atención. Esto es importante en caso de que su hijo se enferme y usted tenga preguntas o necesite ayuda.

La endocarditis bacteriana es una infección del tejido que recubre el corazón (endocardio) o de sus válvulas. No ocurre en los niños muy a menudo, pero cuando lo hace, puede causar graves daños al corazón. La endocarditis bacteriana se produce cuando las bacterias presentes en la sangre entran en el corazón y causan una infección. ¿Cuáles son las causas de la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños? Las bacterias pueden ingresar al cuerpo de muchas maneras. Tener problemas de corazón, especialmente en las válvulas, aumenta la posibilidad de que las bacterias afecten el corazón. Algunas de las formas más comunes en que las bacterias llegan a la sangre son las siguientes: - Trabajos dentales, como una limpieza dental profesional - Cirugía para extirpar las amígdalas o las adenoides - Procedimientos médicos, como un examen de las vías respiratorias con un broncoscopio - Cirugía, como algunas cirugías respiratorias, gastrointestinales o de las vías urinarias ¿Qué niños corren el riesgo de tener endocarditis bacteriana? Un niño está en riesgo de contraer endocarditis bacteriana si tiene algo de lo siguiente: - Válvulas cardíacas artificiales (prótesis) - Ha tenido endocarditis en el pasado - Enfermedad congénita del corazón (presente desde el nacimiento) - Ha tenido un trasplante de corazón (inmunocomprometido), pero las válvulas cardíacas no funcionan correctamente - Catéter venoso central permanente - Enfermedad reumática del corazón - Sistema inmunitario débil Hable con el proveedor de atención médica de su hijo sobre sus factores de riesgo. ¿Cuáles son los síntomas de la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños? Los síntomas pueden presentarse de forma un poco diferente en cada niño. Pueden incluir lo siguiente: - Síntomas parecidos a los de la gripe, como fiebre, escalofríos, cansancio, dolor muscular y de las articulaciones, sudores nocturnos y dolor de cabeza - Falta de aire - Tos - Cambios en la piel, como los siguientes: - Palidez de la piel - Chichones bajo la piel de los dedos de las manos y de los pies - Manchas en las palmas de las manos y las plantas de los pies - Pequeños vasos sanguíneos rotos con pequeñas manchas debajo de las uñas, en el blanco de los ojos, en la boca o en el pecho - Náuseas y vómitos, disminución del apetito, pérdida de peso - Molestias en el estómago - Sangre en la orina - Hinchazón de los pies, de las piernas o del abdomen ¿Cómo se diagnostica la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños? El proveedor de atención médica le hará preguntas sobre los síntomas y los antecedentes médicos de su hijo. Le harán una exploración física y les escucharán el corazón. Otras pruebas pueden incluir las siguientes: - Ecocardiografía. Esta prueba examina la estructura del corazón de su hijo y su funcionamiento. Usa ondas sonoras para crear una imagen en movimiento del corazón y sus válvulas. Es posible que su proveedor de atención médica vea una infección de las válvulas del corazón. - Cultivo de sangre. Esta prueba busca infecciones en la sangre de su hijo. - Hemograma completo (CBC, por sus siglas en inglés). Esta prueba examina todos los tipos de células de la sangre de su hijo. Es decir, glóbulos rojos, glóbulos blancos y plaquetas. ¿Cómo se trata la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños? El tratamiento dependerá de los síntomas, de la edad y del estado de salud general de su hijo. También, de la gravedad de la afección. Un especialista en cardiología infantil (cardiólogo pediátrico) y un especialista en enfermedades infecciosas se ocuparán de su hijo. El tratamiento incluye lo siguiente: - Antibióticos. Los antibióticos suelen administrarse por vía intravenosa (IV) durante varias semanas. Es probable que su hijo deba permanecer en el hospital para recibir el medicamento. A veces, estos antibióticos pueden administrarse en casa con la ayuda de un equipo de atención médica domiciliaria. - Cirugía. Algunos niños pueden necesitar una cirugía de las válvulas del corazón si hay un daño grave debido a la infección. Esto se hace para reparar o reemplazar una válvula cardíaca dañada. O bien, un niño puede necesitar cirugía para ayudar a eliminar la endocarditis. Esto puede hacerse si los antibióticos no funcionan lo suficientemente bien contra la infección. ¿Cuáles son las posibles complicaciones de la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños? Las complicaciones incluyen lo siguiente: - Insuficiencia cardíaca - Coágulos sanguíneos o cúmulos de bacterias que se desplazan a otras partes del cuerpo (émbolos). Estos pueden llegar a las arterias del corazón, el cerebro, el bazo, el intestino, los brazos o las piernas. - Infección en otras partes del corazón - Vasos sanguíneos debilitados (aneurisma), como por ejemplo en el cerebro - Lesión o enfermedad renal - Muerte ¿Qué puedo hacer para prevenir la endocarditis bacteriana en mi hijo? La endocarditis bacteriana no se puede prevenir del todo. Pero hacer algunas cosas puede ayudar. Por ejemplo: - Asegúrese de que su hijo se cuide bien los dientes y las encías - Lleve al niño al dentista con regularidad para limpiezas y controles - Tenga buenas prácticas de higiene - Haga que su hijo tome la prescripción completa de antibióticos cuando se utilicen para tratar infecciones como la infección de garganta por estreptococos Algunos niños con problemas de corazón necesitan tomar antibióticos antes de algunos procedimientos dentales y médicos. Hable con el proveedor de atención médica del niño para saber si su hijo necesita antibióticos. ¿Cómo se maneja la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños? Su hijo necesitará atención continua, que incluye lo siguiente: - Nuevos ecocardiogramas y análisis de sangre después de la infección - Chequeos médicos regulares - Chequeos dentales regulares - Buena higiene bucal diaria (cepillado e hilo dental) ¿Cuándo debo llamar al proveedor de atención médica de mi hijo? Llame de inmediato al proveedor de atención médica de su hijo si este tiene: Información importante sobre la endocarditis bacteriana en los niños - Es una infección del tejido que recubre el corazón, incluidas las válvulas. - Un niño con problemas de corazón tiene más riesgo de contraer endocarditis bacteriana. - Los síntomas son parecidos a los de la gripe. Otros síntomas son tos, cambios en la piel e hinchazón de brazos, piernas o abdomen. - La endocarditis bacteriana se trata con antibióticos o cirugía. - Si se produce un daño importante en las válvulas cardíacas, puede ser necesario practicar una cirugía de sustitución de válvula. - Un buen cuidado dental y una buena higiene corporal son una parte importante de la prevención de la endocarditis bacteriana. Próximos pasos Consejos para ayudarlo a aprovechar al máximo la visita con su proveedor de atención médica: - Tenga en claro la razón de la visita médica y qué quiere que suceda. - Antes de la visita, anote las preguntas que quiere hacer. - Lleve a un acompañante para que lo ayude a formular las preguntas y a recordar qué le dice su proveedor. - En la visita, anote el nombre de los nuevos diagnósticos y de todo nuevo medicamento, tratamiento o prueba. También anote las instrucciones que el proveedor le indique. - Sepa por qué se receta un tratamiento o un medicamento, y cómo lo ayudará. Conozca los efectos secundarios. - Pregunte si su afección se puede tratar de otra forma. - Sepa por qué se recomienda una prueba o un procedimiento y qué podrían significar los resultados. - Sepa qué esperar si no toma el medicamento o no se realiza la prueba o el procedimiento. - Si tiene una visita de control, anote la fecha, la hora y el objetivo de esta. - Sepa cómo comunicarse con su proveedor si tiene preguntas.

       "    'full_doc': 'El asma es una de las principales enfermedades crónicas entre los niños de Estados Unidos, y millones de quienes la padecen son menores de 18 años. Las tasas de asma son más altas entre los niños que viven por debajo del nivel de pobreza y los niños de raza negra, de las comunidades de indios estadounidenses o nativos de Alaska. El asma es la principal causa del ausentismo escolar. A su vez, puede interrumpir el sueño, reducir la capacidad de concentración, la memoria y la participación en las actividades de los niños en el programa. Los programas de la primera infancia pueden asociarse con los proveedores de atención médica y las familias para reducir la exposición de los niños a factores desencadenantes, reconocer las señales de advertencia temprana, tratar los síntomas del asma sin demora y prevenir los episodios de asma. Normalmente, las vías respiratorias conectadas a los pulmones están completamente abiertas cuando respiramos, lo que permite que el aire entre y salga con facilidad. Los niños con asma tienen vías respiratorias muy sensibles que pueden inflamarse fácilmente. Durante un episodio de asma, los niños pueden toser, tener sibilancias y opresión o dolor en el pecho, dificultad para respirar y falta de energía. La inflamación y el estrechamiento de las vías respiratorias del aparato respiratorio es lo que causa estos síntomas. El asma afecta a cada niño de manera diferente. Los factores desencadenantes de los episodios de asma, los signos y síntomas, el tratamiento necesario y la gravedad difieren según la persona. Algunos niños tienen episodios repetidos, o ataques, y necesitan medicamentos diarios y actividades modificadas. Mientras que otros solo necesitan medicamentos durante un episodio. El asma infantil se califica comúnmente como leve, moderada o grave, y puede permanecer igual en cuanto a gravedad, aparecer y desaparecer o cambiar con el tiempo. En los programas Head Start, el gerente de salud desempeña un papel fundamental en la formulación de un plan para asegurarse de que los niños con asma puedan participar en todas las actividades del programa. Este plan a veces se conoce como plan de acción para el asma. Además, el gerente de salud está involucrado de forma integral en la comunicación con la familia. Los proveedores de atención médica pueden ser reacios a diagnosticarle asma a un niño pequeño. Antes de un diagnóstico de asma, el niño podría recibir otro diagnóstico, como vías respiratorias reactivas, bronquiolitis o infección frecuente de las vías respiratorias superiores que necesita tratamiento con nebulizador. A medida que la familia y el proveedor de atención médica detectan los síntomas de un niño, es importante que los programas comuniquen cómo los signos y síntomas mejoran (con el tratamiento con medicamentos) o empeoran (durante la exposición a diferentes factores desencadenantes) para ayudar a encontrar patrones. Los programas deben estar al tanto de los cambios en los medicamentos, incluso si no se administran en el programa, para que puedan apoyar a la familia comunicando la información correcta al proveedor de atención médica. El personal también puede apoyar a las familias observando cuidadosamente a los niños, registrando sus observaciones en la evaluación diaria de la salud y haciendo llegar estos informes a la familia y al proveedor. Factores desencadenantes Un factor desencadenante es cualquier cosa que cause síntomas de asma. Cada niño tiene su propio conjunto de factores desencadenantes. Cuando un programa sabe cuáles son estos factores desencadenantes, el personal puede trabajar para minimizar el riesgo de exposición del niño a dichos factores. Entre los factores desencadenantes comunes están: - ácaros (frecuentes en alfombras, ropa, juguetes de peluche y artículos cubiertos de tela); - humo; - polen (algunos niños tienen brotes de asma en la primavera cuando el recuento de polen es alto o cuando el pasto está recién cortado, sobre todo si las ventanas se dejan abiertas); - moho; - caspa de animales; - contaminación o mala calidad del aire (la contaminación del aire exterior, incluido el humo diésel de los autobuses escolares, puede causar episodios de asma); - productos de limpieza y pesticidas; - perfume y colonia (considere formular una política que no permita que el personal use perfumes); - cambios de temperatura y del estado del tiempo; - actividad física (conocida como asma inducida por el ejercicio); - infecciones respiratorias, gripe y resfriados (la causa más común de episodios de asma); - alimentos (generalmente acompañados de más síntomas como urticaria, sarpullido, vómitos y diarrea). Signos y síntomas Los niños de más edad y los adultos a menudo pueden describir sus síntomas de un episodio de asma. Pero los niños más pequeños no conocen las palabras ni tienen las habilidades comunicativas para describir verbalmente sus síntomas. Es importante que los maestros observen los comportamientos y ayuden a los niños a adquirir el vocabulario necesario para que les hagan saber cuando no se sienten bien. Es igualmente importante que el personal mantenga la calma cuando hable con un niño que tiene un episodio de asma. Los niños pequeños podrían presentar síntomas como: - Sibilancia. Suena como un silbido agudo y áspero. Es posible que escuche las sibilancias cuando el niño exhala. A medida que el episodio evoluciona, es posible que escuche las sibilancias cuando el niño inhala y exhala. - Opresión en el pecho. Los niños más pequeños podrían mostrar signos de que tienen dificultad para respirar o hablar. Podrían presionarse el pecho o sentarse en un rincón y permanecer en silencio. - Dificultad para respirar. El niño podría quejarse de estar sin aliento o de no poder recuperar el aliento. Es posible que vea a los niños más pequeños sentados en silencio tratando de recuperar el aliento. Esté atento a cualquier jadeo, o respiración rápida y ruidosa. Entre los signos de que un niño tiene dificultad para respirar podrían estar el movimiento rápido de las fosas nasales; que las costillas o el estómago se muevan hacia adentro y hacia afuera con profundidad y rapidez; o pecho distendido que no se deshincha cuando el niño exhala. - Tos frecuente. Esto podría ser más común durante la noche. El niño podría o no toser con flema. - Letargo o desinterés en actividades normales o favoritas. - Dificultad para succionar o comer. - Llanto que suena menos fuerte o diferente. Apoyo a los niños con asma El programa, la familia y el proveedor de atención médica deben comunicarse con regularidad para asegurarse de que los niños con asma reciban la atención adecuada. Los programas apoyan las fortalezas de la familia cuando reconocen que los padres saben mucho acerca de su hijo y pueden darle información al personal sobre cuál es la mejor manera de cuidarlo. Aquí encontrará algunas estrategias para interactuar con las familias: - Haga una visita al hogar para ayudar a la familia a determinar y formular un plan para discutir los factores desencadenantes. - Ayude a la familia a prepararse para las visitas de atención de la salud escribiendo una lista de preguntas, inquietudes y descripciones de episodios recientes. - Deles información a los miembros de la familia que no entienden el asma y no saben cómo reconocer los síntomas del niño. - Trabaje con el proveedor de atención médica del niño o con su Comité Asesor de los Servicios de Salud para encontrar recursos comunitarios que ofrezcan información y apoyo sobre el asma. - Organice una reunión con la familia y todas las personas que trabajan con el niño, incluidos los maestros, cuidadores, personal de servicio de alimentos, conductores de autobuses y monitores, para asegurarse de que todos entiendan el plan de acción para el asma del niño. Comuníquese con regularidad con el proveedor de atención médica del niño para asegurarse de que su programa esté actualizado sobre los cambios en el tratamiento. Lo que su programa puede hacer - Utilice sus sistemas de gestión de Head Start. Asegúrese de que las familias, los maestros y los conductores de autobuses estén preparados para supervisar al niño y comunicar información, como cambios en el plan de atención de la salud o medicamentos del niño, la afección del niño y cuándo se administró el medicamento por última vez. - Registre cuándo los niños tienen episodios de asma o están ausentes debido al asma. Consulte su política de administración de medicamentos, protocolos de emergencia, evaluación diaria de la salud y registro de la asistencia. - Informe sobre el tema a todo el personal. ¿El personal sabe qué hacer si un niño tiene un ataque de asma? ¿El personal está capacitado para administrar medicamentos con inhaladores y nebulizadores de rescate? - Tenga preparado un plan de acción para el asma para cada niño con asma. ¿Todos los miembros del personal saben dónde están esos planes? ¿Todos los cuidadores del niño conocen los factores desencadenantes y los síntomas de cada niño? - Deles información sobre el asma a los niños pequeños de más edad y a los niños en edad preescolar. Hable a menudo con los niños sobre el asma, sus síntomas y lo que hará si alguien tiene un ataque de asma. - Elimine o reduzca los factores desencadenantes. Planifique actividades en interiores los días que haya concentraciones elevadas de ozono. - Mejore la ventilación de toda la instalación. Reemplace los filtros HEPA con regularidad. - Asegúrese de que los sistemas de calefacción y aire acondicionado reciban el mantenimiento adecuado. - Limpie las alfombras con frecuencia. - Reduzca la exposición al humo de segunda y tercera mano. Por ejemplo, pídale al personal que fuma en su casa que se cambie de ropa cuando llegue al programa; formule una política que no permita que el personal o las familias fumen en las proximidades de la instalación. - Asóciese con el proveedor de atención médica. El proveedor de atención médica del niño puede darle información sobre los factores desencadenantes, signos y síntomas, gravedad, frecuencia e intervenciones recomendadas. - Facilite la transición al kindergarten u otro programa. Pídale permiso a la familia para comunicarles a los futuros maestros las necesidades médicas del niño. Asegúrese de que la familia haya formulado un plan de acción para el asma antes de hacer la transición desde su programa. Plan de acción para el asma Los planes de acción para el asma (en inglés) deben apoyar al programa en el cuidado de los niños con asma y en la comunicación con la familia y el proveedor. Estos deben incluir: - Adaptaciones específicas necesarias en las actividades diarias del niño (p. ej., dieta, actividades en el aula y al aire libre, excursiones). - Los medicamentos regulares y de emergencia del niño, incluidos el nombre, la dosis, la vía, el horario, las indicaciones para la administración y los posibles efectos secundarios. - Dónde deben guardarse los medicamentos en diferentes situaciones, como por ejemplo, cuando salen al aire libre, en excursiones y durante simulacros de incendio u otras actividades de preparación para emergencias. - Los signos y síntomas de un ataque de asma y las respuestas correctas (p. ej., eliminar los factores desencadenantes, medicamentos, observación, plan de emergencia). - Qué síntomas indican una emergencia. - Qué pasos dar en caso de emergencia. - Información de contacto de la familia y del proveedor de atención médica. - Instrucciones específicas para las condiciones ambientales (p. ej., participación en juegos al aire libre cuando la calidad del aire [en inglés] es perjudicial). Usted puede adaptar un ejemplo de plan de acción para el asma (en inglés) para satisfacer las necesidades de cada niño. Al igual que con otras afecciones médicas, usted debe revisar el plan de acción para el asma del niño al menos cada tres o seis meses y después de cualquier cambio en la medicación, visita a la sala de emergencias u hospitalización.

       "    'full_doc': 'La investigación analizó la relación de los acontecimientos vitales estresantes (AVE) con la sintomatología, externalizante e internalizante, y la adaptación escolar y familiar en la infancia. El número de participantes fue 552, 53.4% niños y 46.6% niñas, de 10 a 12 años. Se comparó un grupo clínico de salud mental con un grupo comunitario. Al menos un AVE ha sido experimentado por el 88.2% de los participantes en los dos últimos años. Los AVE registrados son significativamente superiores en el grupo clínico. Los AVE se relacionan con presencia de sintomatología y menor adaptación, siendo mayor la asociación entre los AVE de tipo familiar y los síntomas de hiperactividad en el grupo clínico. El haber experimentado AVE y el ser paciente predicen tanto la sintomatología como la adaptación. This paper studied the relationship between stressful life events (SLE) and psychological symptoms (externalizing and internalizing symptomatology) and school and family adaptation in childhood. Participants were 552, 53.4% boys and 46.6% girls, aged between 10-12 years. Patients receiving treatment in mental health services and a community group were compared. At least one SLE in the past two years is experienced by 88.2% of children. SLE were significantly higher in the clinical group than in the community group. SLE are related to the increased presence of symptoms and lower levels of adaptation. The association between family SLE and hyperactivity symptoms is stronger in the clinical group than in the community group. Having experienced SLE and being a patient predict both symptomatology and adaptation. El término estresor hace referencia a las experiencias ambientales que amenazan la salud o el bienestar, siendo esta la característica definitoria de la investigación del estrés en la infancia y la adolescencia (Grant et al., 2003). Los acontecimientos vitales estresantes (AVE) han generado un productivo campo de estudio. Conocer los factores de riesgo de psicopatología es esencial para la prevención y la intervención en la infancia. Los datos disponibles indican que en torno al 80% de los niños y adolescentes ha experimentado al menos un AVE negativo (Ferreira, Granero, Noorian, Romero y Domènech-Llabería, 2012), siendo algunos datos próximos al 100% (Flouri y Panourgia, 2011). Cifras menos alarmantes, pero no menos importantes, aparecen en una encuesta con niños y adolescentes en EE. UU. publicada por Balistreri (2015), donde más de la mitad (53%) había experimentado alguna experiencia adversa, 28% al menos dos y 15% tres o más. En población clínica también en EE. UU., McLaughlin et al. (2012) encontraron que el 58.3% de los adolescentes con trastorno mental había vivido al menos una adversidad. En los estudios se ha informado de un promedio de dos o tres AVE en niños y adolescentes (Mitchell, Tynes, Umaña-Taylor y Williams, 2015; Platt, Williams y Ginsburg, 2016). Sanz et al. (2009) registraron un promedio cercano a seis eventos en pacientes de salud mental, incluso algunos pacientes habían experimentado hasta quince AVE. Al considerar únicamente los eventos independientes del niño y/o de su familia, Sandberg, Rutter, Pickles, McGuinness y Angold (2001) encontraron en torno a un AVE, siendo ligeramente superior en los pacientes derivados al servicio de psiquiatría, resultados que son similares a los de Willemen, Koot, Ferdinand, Goossens y Schuengel (2008) con niños y adolescentes derivados a salud mental. En general, se ha observado más AVE en población clínica que en población general: seis eventos en niños y adolescentes diagnosticados de trastorno depresivo mayor (Mayer et al., 2009) y mayor exposición a AVE durante el año previo en los niños con depresión en comparación con los niños con ansiedad o sin sintomatología (Williamson, Birmaher, Dahl y Ryan, 2005). La mayoría de los estudios han tratado de probar el efecto acumulativo de los AVE en las alteraciones psicopatológicas. Desde esta perspectiva de la exposición al estrés, se parte de la idea básica que la acumulación de AVE se relaciona con los síntomas. Los resultados indican que los AVE incrementan los problemas internalizantes, externalizantes y de adaptación de los niños y adolescentes, con evidencia tanto en diseños transversales (Flouri y Panourgia, 2011; Matos et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2015) como longitudinales (Estévez, Oliva y Parra, 2012; Morales y Guerra, 2006). No obstante, estos resultados no son consistentes, sino que en algunos estudios aparece una relación parcial (Gustafsson, Larsson, Nelson y Gustafsson, 2009) o se establece en interacción con otras variables. Por ejemplo, las estrategias de regulación emocional cognitivas desadaptativas mediaban la relación entre los AVE y los síntomas depresivos (Stikkelbroek, Hodden, Kleinjan, Reijnders y van Baar, 2016), mientras que la gran reactividad de la respuesta de cortisol de los adolescentes mediaba la asociación entre los AVE y los comportamientos externalizantes e internalizantes (Steeger, Cook y Connell, 2017). También se ha examinado el papel del contexto familiar: la asociación entre los AVE y la gravedad de los síntomas de ansiedad estaba mediada por el nivel de estrés de los progenitores, el estilo de crianza ansioso y las interacciones disfuncionales progenitores-hijos (Platt et al., 2016). Los AVE constituyen uno de los factores de riesgo de autolesiones en adolescentes (Zhang, Song y Wang, 2016) y además los adolescentes con intentos autolíticos informaron de mayor número de AVE en el año previo (Liu y Tein, 2005). Dahl et al. (2017) comprobaron que la exposición a eventos adversos en la infancia y la adolescencia se asociaba con un aumento del riesgo de depresión en la adolescencia y la adultez, defendiendo que ciertos eventos pueden ser más dañinos si ocurren en determinados períodos del desarrollo. Los AVE pueden categorizarse en función de su contenido. Williamson et al. (2005) clasificaron los AVE en independientes del comportamiento del niño (p. ej., fallecimiento de una familiar o amigo) y dependientes del comportamiento (p. ej., aumento de las discusiones con los progenitores); ambos tipos de eventos, a su vez, podían representar una pérdida o no. Mayer et al. (2009) agruparon los AVE en cuatro temáticas: salud de los progenitores (p. ej., ingreso hospitalario), fallecimiento de familiares cercanos (p. ej., de un progenitor), sociodemográficos (p. ej., desempleo de un progenitor) e intrafamiliar (p. ej., nacimiento de un hermano o separación de los progenitores). Los AVE relacionados con la salud de los progenitores, fallecimiento de un familiar cercano y los intrafamiliares se asociaron con el trastorno depresivo mayor, asociación que fue más fuerte con la salud de los progenitores y el fallecimiento de un familiar cercano en los niños más pequeños que en los adolescentes (Mayer et al., 2009). Los trastornos depresivos se han relacionado con experiencias de pérdida y dolor (Tiet et al., 2001) y con los episodios de pérdida independientes, más prevalentes en niños con depresión que en niños con ansiedad, lo que sugiere que este tipo de AVE podrían ser específicos de la depresión en la infancia (Williamson et al., 2005). Sin embargo, la revisión de McMahon, Grant, Compas, Thurm y Ey (2003) mostró escasa evidencia de la especificidad de las relaciones entre estresores y síntomas psicológicos: más bien los resultados eran coherentes con los principios de equifinalidad y multifinalidad. Stikkelbroek et al. (2016) tampoco hallaron relación entre las situaciones de pérdida (p. ej., fallecimiento) y los síntomas depresivos, aunque sí observaron asociación entre los AVE de cambios relacionales (p. ej., separación de los progenitores) y de amenaza para la salud con los síntomas depresivos. La mayor parte de la literatura sobre los AVE se centra en la etapa de la adolescencia, olvidando otros momentos evolutivos como la infancia. Las investigaciones sobre los AVE muestran una amplia variabilidad que dificulta la comparación de los resultados. Los datos aportados difieren en función del instrumento de medida, el marco temporal y el tipo de AVE que registra, por mencionar algunos. La confusión conceptual se hace aún más patente cuando no se distinguen AVE agudos y crónicos, negativos y positivos, deseables o no deseables, dependientes e independientes del comportamiento del individuo, AVE y estresores cotidianos, o ítems relacionados con el comportamiento o la psicopatología. Pocos son los estudios que evalúan los AVE negativos independientes del niño o adolescente (Sandberg et al., 2001; Tiet et al., 2001; Willemen et al., 2008). El presente trabajo analiza la relación entre los AVE, la sintomatología, externalizante e internalizante, y el nivel de adaptación escolar y familiar en la infancia, y se examinan las posibles diferencias entre población clínica y población comunitaria. Se espera que los AVE se relacionen con mayor prevalencia de síntomas y menor nivel de adaptación, así como que las asociaciones sean más altas en el grupo clínico.MétodoParticipantes En la investigación participaron 552 niños y niñas de 10 a 12 años de edad. Los participantes del grupo clínico eran pacientes de la red pública de Servicios de Salud Mental Infanto-Juvenil del Área Sanitaria del Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal. El grupo comunitario estaba compuesto por escolares de los centros educativos públicos y concertados de la misma zona. Los participantes constituyen una muestra incidental, en el grupo clínico procedente de tres centros de salud mental, y en el grupo comunitario, de siete centros educativos. Se excluyeron participantes que seguían la modalidad educativa de ACNEE (alumno con necesidades educativas especiales) o con dificultades en el manejo del idioma. En el grupo clínico no se incluyeron pacientes con trastorno mental o sintomatología activa grave que pudiese interferir en la comunicación y la comprensión. En el grupo comunitario se excluyeron los escolares en tratamiento psicológico y/o psiquiátrico. Se recogieron datos de 580 niños y niñas, pero se excluyó de los análisis a 27 escolares (4.7%) en tratamiento psicológico y/o psiquiátrico y a un paciente porque el motivo de consulta era un AVE de tipo traumático. En el grupo clínico había 94 pacientes (16.2%) y en el grupo comunitario 458 escolares (79.1%). Según su distribución por sexo, 53.4% eran hombres y 46.6% mujeres. Los menores cursaban de 4° de educación primaria a 1° de E.S.O. (en los centros educativos se administró el protocolo sólo en 5° y 6° de primaria). La descripción de los participantes se puede ver en la tabla 1.Variables y medidas Datos sociodemográficos. Edad, sexo, curso escolar y estatus socioeconómico. Las preguntas para evaluar el estatus socioeconómico fueron tomadas del Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA; OECD, 2012), que recoge los recursos materiales que dispone el niño para el aprendizaje o el ocio (RMN: p. ej., mesa de estudio, ordenador para tareas escolares o habitación individual) y los recursos materiales del hogar (RMH: p. ej., número de teléfonos móviles o número de coches). Ave. Listado de 20 sucesos ocurridos en los dos últimos años, creado ad hoc para el estudio. Todos eran sucesos independientes, de carácter negativo, fuera del control del niño, que no podían confundirse con su comportamiento o psicopatología y que suponían algún tipo de pérdida, como la separación (temporal o definitiva) de sus figuras de apego, de otras personas significativas o de su contexto conocido. No se incluyeron sucesos traumáticos o crónicos (p. ej., maltrato o abuso). Tras revisión de la literatura (Johnson, 1986; Mayer et al., 2009; Williamson et al., 2005), los AVE se agruparon en cuatro contenidos: enfermedad (AVE-enf: p. ej., “tu padre o tu madre han estado muy enfermos en el hospital”), fallecimiento (AVE-fall: p. ej., “tu padre ha muerto”), familiar (AVE-fam: p. ej., “tus padres se han separado”) y socioeconómico (AVE-SE: p. ej., “tu padre o tu madre ahora trabajan más y están mucho tiempo fuera de casa”). Sintomatología. Cuestionario de capacidades y dificultades [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire] (SDQ-Cas; Goodman, 1997; Goodman, Meltzer y Bailey, 1998). Autoinforme compuesto por 25 ítems para niños y adolescentes, entre 11 y 16 años. Se obtiene una puntuación total (SDQ-T) y de las cinco subescalas, síntomas emocionales, problemas de conducta, hiperactividad, problemas de relación con iguales y conducta prosocial. Las cuatro subescalas de síntomas se pueden reducir a dos factores de segundo orden, síntomas externalizantes (SDQ-E) y síntomas internalizantes (SDQ-I). La consistencia interna fue .78 para SDQ-T, .72 para SDQ-E y .7 para SDQ-I y algo más baja en las subescalas. Estos valores son similares a los obtenidos con la adaptación española (Ortuño-Sierra, Fonseca-Pedrero, Paino, Sastre y Muñiz, 2015) y con niños de menor edad (Muris, Meesters, Eijkelenboom y Vincken, 2004; Van Roy, Grøholt, Heyerdahl y Clench-Aas, 2006). El SDQ-Cas es un instrumento útil para evaluar las dificultades emocionales y de comportamiento en población infanto-juvenil (Ortuño-Sierra, Fonseca-Pedrero, Inchausti y Sastre, 2016). Síntomas depresivos (Modified Depression Scale) (MDS; Orpinas, 1993; citado en Dahlberg, Toal, Swahn y Behrens, 2005). Cuestionario de síntomas depresivos en el último mes, compuesto por 6 ítems con 5 alternativas de respuesta. Se puede administrar desde los 10 a los 18 años. El MDS ha sido empleado en diversos estudios, que destacan su brevedad y que es una medida de libre acceso (Dunn, Johnson y Green, 2012). Se siguieron las directrices para la traducción y adaptación de los tests de la Comisión Internacional de Tests (ITC; Muñiz, Elosua y Hambleton, 2013). La consistencia interna fue .65. Adaptación escolar. Autoinforme formado por 10 ítems, con 4 alternativas de respuesta, adaptados del estudio PISA (OECD, 2012). Puntuaciones más altas reflejan mayor inadaptación. La consistencia interna, α de Cronbach, fue .49. Se analizó la estructura interna mediante el programa FACTOR (Lorenzo-Seva y Ferrando, 2013) utilizando correlaciones policóricas. El estadístico KMO (Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin) dio un valor de .72, mostrando una buena adecuación para la factorización. El análisis paralelo aconsejó la extracción de dos factores, el primero relacionado con sentido de pertenencia al colegio, que denominamos adaptación escolar al colegio (AEC: p. ej., “me gusta mi colegio”, “el colegio es una pérdida de tiempo”) y el segundo con la relación con aprendizaje y profesor, que llamamos adaptación escolar al aprendizaje (AEA: p. ej., “mis profesores me ayudan cuando lo necesito”, “es importante hacer los deberes y estudiar los exámenes”), que explican el 48% de la varianza total. La factorización se realizó mediante el procedimiento de mínimos cuadrados no ponderados y los coeficientes para los factores fueron .78 y .79, respectivamente. El ajuste del modelo fue aceptable, con un índice de RMSR [Rout Mean Square of Residuals] de .04. Adaptación familiar. Autoinforme creado ad hoc de 11 ítems y 4 alternativas de respuesta (p. ej., “me gusta hacer cosas con mis padres y con mi familia”, “mis padres saben el nombre de mis amigos”). Las puntuaciones altas reflejan mayor inadaptación. La estructura interna se analizó mediante el programa FACTOR (Lorenzo-Seva y Ferrando, 2013), utilizando la matriz de correlaciones policóricas. El estadístico KMO dio un valor de .75, indicando una buena adecuación para la factorización. El análisis paralelo aconsejó la extracción de un único factor, que explica el 45% de la varianza total. La factorización se realizó mediante el procedimiento de mínimos cuadrados no ponderados y el coeficiente de fiabilidad fue de .82. El ajuste del modelo fue aceptable, con un índice de RMSR de .04.Diseño y procedimiento La investigación fue aprobada por el Comité Ético y de Investigación Clínica del Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, de la Comunidad de Madrid. El protocolo se aplicó durante el curso escolar. En el grupo clínico se administró el día que acudían a consulta en salud mental y en el grupo comunitario en el horario escolar. Previo a la investigación se desarrolló un estudio piloto que incluyó la traducción y retrotraducción del MDS (Orpinas, 1993; citado en Dahlberg et al., 2005) y la aplicación de todos los instrumentos a niños de 9 a 12 años. Por ese motivo se modificó la redacción de algunos ítems, que permitió constatar que el SDQ-Cas (Goodman, 1997) se podía aplicar en la franja de edad de la investigación y que el tiempo empleado en cumplimentar el protocolo oscilaba entre 15 y 30 minutos. Como último paso se compararon las modalidades de aplicación, individual y colectiva, en uno de los centros escolares, dado que en el grupo clínico el protocolo se iba a aplicar de manera individual y en el grupo comunitario de forma colectiva. Se llevaron a cabo contrastes con la prueba t de muestras independientes paramétricas en variables sociodemográficas, AVE, sintomatología y adaptación. El estadístico de Levene mostró que se cumplía el supuesto de igualdad de varianzas y la prueba t para la igualdad de medias no mostró diferencias: t(25) = -0.43 en sexo, -0.45 en edad, 1.17 en AVE, 0.11 en SDQ-T, -0.52 en SDQ-E, 0.57 en SDQ-I, -0.14 en MDS, 1.3 en adaptación familiar y 1.97 en adaptación escolar. Estos análisis confirmaron que la modalidad de aplicación no interfería en los contrastes.Análisis de datos Se obtuvieron los estadísticos descriptivos de las variables examinadas. Para analizar las diferencias entre los grupos, se efectuaron contrastes de Levene para la homogeneidad de varianzas y la prueba t de comparación de medias. Dado que no se cumplía el supuesto de normalidad, las diferencias también fueron examinadas con el contraste no paramétrico U de Mann-Whitney. Como medida del tamaño de efecto se utilizó el estadístico eta cuadrado. También se compararon las proporciones de los AVE entre los grupos mediante el estadístico ji-cuadrado y la diferencia de proporciones, calculando como tamaño de efecto con el estadístico V de Cramer. Para observar la relación entre los AVE y los síntomas y la adaptación se calcularon correlaciones de Pearson. Las variables dependientes pronosticadas a partir de los AVE y las variables sociodemográficas fueron: sintomatología (SDQ-T, SDQ-E, SDQ-I y MDS), adaptación familiar y adaptación escolar (puntuación total: AET y los dos factores: AEC y AEA). Se realizó mediante regresión lineal jerárquica en tres bloques, introduciendo como predictores en el primer bloque las variables sociodemográficas para controlar su efecto (sexo, edad y estatus socioeconómico), en el segundo bloque el tipo de participante (del grupo clínico o del grupo comunitario) y en el tercer bloque los cuatro contenidos temáticos de AVE. Los análisis de datos se llevaron a cabo con el programa estadístico SPSS versión 22.0 (IBM Corp., 2013). Para la comparación de los coeficientes de correlación se ha accedido a un programa disponible online denominado VassarStats (Lowry, 2001).Resultados Los estadísticos descriptivos de las variables se presentan en la tabla 2. La prueba t de muestras independientes mostró diferencias estadísticamente significativas (p = .003, unilateral), con el promedio del grupo clínico superior al del grupo comunitario. Estadísticos descriptivos de las variables del estudio Nota. AVE-T = AVE total, AVE-Enf = AVE enfermedad, AVE-Fall = AVE fallecimiento, AVE-Fam = AVE familiar, AVE-SE = AVE socioeconómico, SDQ-T = Cuestionario de capacidades y dificultades – puntuación total, SDQ-E = síntomas externalizantes, SDQ-I = síntomas internalizantes, MDS = Modified Depression Scale, AF = adaptación familiar, AET = adaptación escolar total, AEC = adaptación escolar colegio, AEA = adaptación escolar aprendizaje. Los análisis revelaron que el 88.2% del total de participantes había experimentado al menos un AVE en los dos últimos años: 94.4% en el grupo clínico y 87.2% en el grupo comunitario. Algunos niños habían tenido 6 o más AVE: 19% del total, 27.7% en el grupo clínico y 17.2% en el grupo comunitario. El contenido temático más frecuente fue el AVE-fall (60.8% del total de participantes había experimentado al menos un AVE de esta categoría), seguido del AVE-SE (57.7%), AVE-fam (43.8%) y AVE-enf (38.2%). El tipo de AVE más frecuente fue el fallecimiento de un familiar (que no fuese progenitor o hermano), en torno al 60% (58% del total, 60.6% en el grupo clínico y 57.5% en el grupo comunitario). La comparación de la proporción de ocurrencia mostró diferencias significativas, con mayor proporción en el grupo clínico que en el grupo comunitario de los siguientes AVE respectivamente: 27.7% vs. 15.1% en cambio de colegio, χ2(1) = 8.68, p = .01; 27.7% vs. 16.9% en pérdida de empleo de los progenitores, χ2(2) = 6.27, p = .05; 31.9% vs. 19.3% en separación de los progenitores, χ2(2) = 7.52, p = .05; 7.4% vs. 1.5% en fallecimiento de padre, χ2(1) = 11.02, p = .01. Respecto a la sintomatología, en el grupo clínico los AVE total y AVE familiar se asociaron positiva y significativamente con SDQ-T, SDQ-E y SDQ hiperactividad y los síntomas depresivos (MDS). En el grupo comunitario, los AVE correlacionaron positiva y significativamente con la sintomatología. Al comparar los coeficientes de correlación, sólo se encontraron diferencias significativas entre los grupos en la asociación AVE familiar - SDQ hiperactividad (z = 1.83, p = .034), con mayor correlación en los pacientes. En cuanto a la adaptación, en el grupo clínico sólo fue estadísticamente significativa la correlación entre AVE fallecimiento y menor adaptación escolar total. En el grupo comunitario, los AVE correlacionaron con menor adaptación familiar y escolar. Las correlaciones entre los AVE y la sintomatología y la adaptación se recogen en la tabla 3. Correlaciones de Pearson AVE y sintomatología y adaptación Nota. AVE-T = AVE total, AVE-enf = AVE enfermedad, AVE-fall = AVE fallecimiento, AVE-fam = AVE familiar, AVE-SE = AVE socioeconómico, SDQ = Cuestionario de capacidades y dificultades, SDQ-T = puntuación total, SDQ-E = síntomas externalizantes, SDQ-I = síntomas internalizantes, SDQ-SE = síntomas emocionales, SDQ-PC = problemas conducta, SDQ-H = hiperactividad, SDQ-PS = problemas compañeros, MDS = Modified Depression Scale. AF = adaptación familiar, AET = adaptación escolar total, AEC = adaptación escolar al colegio, AEA = adaptación escolar al aprendizaje. En el análisis de regresión lineal múltiple para la predicción de la sintomatología, los predictores estadísticamente significativos para SDQ-T fueron ser paciente, AVE-enf, AVE-fall y AVE-SE, explicando el 16% de la varianza. Los coeficientes significativos para SDQ-E fueron el sexo masculino, ser paciente, AVE-fall y AVE-SE, explicando también el 16% de la varianza. Para SDQ-I resultaron significativos el sexo femenino, ser paciente, AVE-enf y AVE-SE, explicando el 12% de la varianza. Para los síntomas depresivos (MDS) fueron significativos el sexo femenino, ser paciente, AVE-enf, AVE-fall y AVE-SE, que predijeron el 16% de la varianza. En cuanto a la adaptación familiar, se relacionó negativamente con los recursos materiales del hogar (a mayor número de recursos mayor adaptación), mayor edad y AVE-SE, explicando el 9% de varianza. En la adaptación escolar total resultaron significativos los coeficientes de ser paciente, mayor edad, AVE-enf, AVE-fall y AVE-SE, que predijeron el 7% de la varianza. En la AEC, ser paciente, AVE-fall y AVE-SE fueron predictivas, también con el 7% de varianza explicativa, mientras que en AEA se relacionó positivamente con los recursos materiales del niño (a mayor número de recursos, mayor desadaptación), ser paciente, mayor edad y AVE-enf, explicando el 5% de la varianza. Los resultados aparecen en la tabla 4. AVE y sintomatología y adaptación familiar y escolar: resultados de la regresión Nota. AVE-enf = AVE enfermedad, AVE-fall = AVE fallecimiento, AVE-fam = AVE familiar, AVE-SE = AVE socioeconómico, SDQ = Cuestionario de capacidades y dificultades, SDQ-T = puntuación total, SDQ-E = síntomas externalizantes, SDQ-I = síntomas internalizantes, MDS = Modified Depression Scale, AF = adaptación familiar, AET = adaptación escolar total, AEC = adaptación escolar colegio, AEA = adaptación escolar aprendizaje, RMN = recursos materiales del menor, RMH = recursos materiales del hogar. R2 corr = R2 corregida; R2 no corr = R2 no corregida. En este trabajo se ha examinado las relaciones entre los AVE y la sintomatología y el funcionamiento adaptativo en niños de 10 a 12 años, comparando pacientes en tratamiento en salud mental con alumnos de centros educativos sin tratamiento. Aproximadamente el 10% de los participantes no había tenido ningún AVE en los últimos dos años, es decir, cerca del 90% informó haber experimentado al menos un AVE. Estas cifras son superiores al 50% ó 60% informadas tanto en población general (Balistreri, 2015) como en población clínica (McLaughlin et al., 2012). No obstante nuestros datos se acercan a los obtenidos en otros estudios (Ferreira et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2015), incluso hasta 98% se ha referido en población general (Flouri y Panourgia, 2011) o en pacientes de salud mental (Sanz et al., 2009). Las cifras más sorprendentes, podríamos decir alarmantes, fueron que el 19% de los participantes había tenido seis o más AVE, siendo 17.2% en los escolares y llegando a 27% en los pacientes. La categoría de AVE de fallecimiento y el fallecimiento de un familiar cercano fueron los eventos más frecuentes, lo cual podría tener que ver con la edad de los participantes, en la que es más probable que ocurra el fallecimiento de un abuelo que el nacimiento de un hermano. El promedio de AVE superó los tres eventos, siendo significativamente superior en el grupo clínico, promedio similar al observado en otros estudios (Mitchell et al., 2015; Platt et al., 2016), que también han encontrado más AVE en población clínica que en población general (Mayer et al., 2009; Sandberg et al., 2001; Williamson et al., 2005). Los análisis apuntaron una mayor proporción de cambio de colegio, pérdida de empleo de los progenitores, separación de los padres y fallecimiento de padre en el grupo clínico. Los AVE se relacionaron con la sintomatología. Sin embargo, no se reflejó mayor afectación en el grupo clínico en comparación con el grupo comunitario, con la excepción de que en el primero fue mayor la correlación entre los AVE familiares y los síntomas de hiperactividad. Si revisamos el contenido de los AVE familiares, en su mayoría situaciones decididas por los progenitores, es posible que cierta sintomatología en los niños que acuden a salud mental tenga que ver con los cambios en el contexto familiar. No obstante, las conclusiones han de ser tomadas con precaución puesto que no se dispone de los antecedentes psicopatológicos de los menores. Respecto al nivel de adaptación, en el grupo comunitario los AVE se asociaron con menor adaptación escolar y familiar mientras que en el grupo clínico apenas hubo relación entre las variables. Al contrario de lo estimado, se observaron más asociaciones entre las variables en el grupo comunitario que en el grupo clínico, lo que podría deberse a la mayor variabilidad por el mayor tamaño de la muestra. En la predicción de la sintomatología externalizante, internalizante y depresiva, los AVE de contenido de fallecimiento, enfermedad y socioeconómico, el sexo masculino o femenino y el ser paciente explicaron del 12% al 16% de la varianza, mientras que en la predicción de la adaptación familiar y escolar los AVE de fallecimiento, enfermedad y socioeconómico, el ser paciente y el estatus socioeconómico explicaron del 5% al 9%. Buena parte de la literatura, en su mayoría con población general, ha mostrado cómo la exposición a los AVE incrementa los problemas internalizantes y externalizantes (Estévez et al., 2012; Matos et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2015; Morales y Guerra, 2006) y los hallazgos de este estudio apuntan en la misma dirección. La importancia de este estudio radica en el escaso número de investigaciones con población infantil y de salud mental. Los resultados apuntan a que una detección precoz de los AVE en el contexto escolar o en la consulta de pediatría podría poner en marcha medidas de apoyo escolares, familiares o en el entorno comunitario con la finalidad de prevenir o reducir ulteriores dificultades. Entre las principales limitaciones del estudio están el diseño no experimental y transversal que no permite extraer relaciones de causalidad, la participación voluntaria y el requisito de autorización de los tutores legales, que ha podido suponer que no hayan aceptado participar aquellos menores o familias con más dificultades, con el consiguiente sesgo de pérdida de información importante. También el empleo exclusivo de medidas de autoinforme, sin contrastar con otras fuentes de información (progenitores, docentes, etc.). Sin embargo, la aplicación de autoinformes es paradojicamente una fortaleza de esta investigación, puesto que los niños han informado directamente de sus emociones y síntomas, a diferencia del modo de proceder habitual, donde los progenitores son los que registran los síntomas de sus hijos. A pesar de la tendencia a considerar que los AVE se asocian con las alteraciones psicológicas, la evidencia no es concluyente. Este trabajo pretende ser una aportación al campo del estrés en la infancia y a la salud mental de los niños y niñas en tratamiento. Seguir ampliando el conocimiento de los factores de riesgo y protección de psicopatología en la infancia contribuirá a mejorar la atención en esta etapa y en momentos posteriores de la vida.Conflicto de intereses Las autoras de este artículo declaran que no tienen ningún conflicto de intereses.',\n",
