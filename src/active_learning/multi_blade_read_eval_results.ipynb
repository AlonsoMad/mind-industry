In 2005, 66% of the new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in women occurred in black women, compared with 17% in white women and 14% in Hispanic women (1). HIV was the third leading cause of death for black women aged 25--44 years and the fourth leading cause of death for Hispanic women aged 35--44 years (3).

If your child can already drink from a cup but refuses to do so or refuses to give up the bottle, you might have to take away all bottles completely at one time. This method applies to children 15 to 18 months and older who use the bottle for comfort or habit and not for food.   \n",

HIV-1 antibody prevalence for childbearing women has been measured by using blinded serologic testing of blood samples collected on filter paper from newborns to measure maternal antibody. In the state of New York, preliminary results of 52,326 tests indicate an overall HIV-1 antibody prevalence of 0.8%. In New York City, one woman in 61 giving birth had HIV-1 antibody. An estimated 40% of these women passed the infection to their newborns. This survey was instrumental in promoting the recent institution of a New York policy to encourage counseling all women of childbearing age and to offer both counseling and testing to women contemplating pregnancy or in the early stages of pregnancy.   \n",

       "1        Cada vez está más claro, en especial en el caso de los meduloblastomas, que el desenlace también se relaciona con las características moleculares del tumor; sin embargo, esto no se ha demostrado de forma definitiva en el caso de otros tumores embrionarios.[1,5,6,19-21] Las tasas de SG oscilan entre el 40 % y el 90 %, según el subtipo molecular de meduloblastoma y, posiblemente, según otros factores como el grado de diseminación en el momento del diagnóstico y el alcance de la resección. Los niños con meduloblastoma que sobreviven durante 5 años se consideran curados de su tumor. Por lo general, las tasas de supervivencia para otros tumores son más precarias y oscilan entre el 5 % y el 50 %.

El objetivo de este estudio es identificar los genes que controlan cómo se forman los cilios. Los cilios son estructuras de aspecto similar a un cabello que tapizan las vías respiratorias y protegen el pulmón normal. El estudio también identificará cómo las mutaciones de estos genes pueden causar PCD. Este estudio se lleva a cabo en Chapel Hill (Carolina del Norte).

       "1        Cada vez está más claro, en especial en el caso de los meduloblastomas, que el desenlace también se relaciona con las características moleculares del tumor; sin embargo, esto no se ha demostrado de forma definitiva en el caso de otros tumores embrionarios.[1,5,6,19-21] Las tasas de SG oscilan entre el 40 % y el 90 %, según el subtipo molecular de meduloblastoma y, posiblemente, según otros factores como el grado de diseminación en el momento del diagnóstico y el alcance de la resección. Los niños con meduloblastoma que sobreviven durante 5 años se consideran curados de su tumor. Por lo general, las tasas de supervivencia para otros tumores son más precarias y oscilan entre el 5 % y el 50 %. Las tasas de supervivencia específicas se tratan en cada subgrupo en este resumen.[22-25]   \n",

El objetivo de este estudio es identificar los genes que controlan cómo se forman los cilios. Los cilios son estructuras de aspecto similar a un cabello que tapizan las vías respiratorias y protegen el pulmón normal. El estudio también identificará cómo las mutaciones de estos genes pueden causar PCD. Este estudio se lleva a cabo en Chapel Hill (Carolina del Norte).
