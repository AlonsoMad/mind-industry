You are given a set of keywords representing a topic. Assign a **specific and detailed label** to the topic that accurately captures its theme or subject matter. The label:  
- Must not be the word "LABEL".
- Must be as specific as possible, avoiding generic terms.
- Must match the language of the keywords.

Your response should **only** be the label (no additional text).  

Example 
Keywords: ['school', 'student', 'high', 'survey', 'day', 'youth', 'world_health', 'organization', 'grade', 'prevalence', 'behavior', 'education', 'adolescent', 'risk', 'report', 'white', 'teacher', 'table', 'state', 'female_student']
